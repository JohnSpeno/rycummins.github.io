I am a Senior Engineer at Comcast. I mostly work on infrastructure automation in hybrid cloud environments, using tools like [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html), and [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/).

I grew up in King of Prussia, PA, spent a few years in Raleigh and Seattle, and currently live in one of Philadelphia's best neighborhoods, Passyunk Square. My favorite thing about the neighborhood is being able to walk to top notch restaurants and specialty markets/grocery stores.

Outside of work I enjoy traveling, cooking/eating, going on walks with my dog, attending concerts/theater, and watching Phillies baseball.
